                <h2>What is the TheButterflyProject?</h2>
                <p>The goal of TheButterflyProject is to show how a population
                    of animals evolve and change depending on their environment.
                    We aim to do this in a fun and educational way.
                    To do this we have created a game-like software,
                    with an evolution system, where “the player” is a predator with the aim of
                    catching butterflies. These butterflies are of different patterns and/or colours
                    (depending on the configuration), and therefore some will be harder to catch than others.
                    The time available to the player will decrease on each round
                    (also depending on configuration), making the game harder.
                    Since some butterflies will be easier to spot, they will also be targeted first.
                    This will make the genes of those butterflies less common,
                    and therefore those butterflies will have a lower likelihood of appearing next round.
                    This is meant to mirror how real world butterflies (and other animals) can adapt to its
                    environment by the process of evolution.

                    <h2>Why use the TheButterflyProject?</h2>
                    <p>We believe that this project could be useful as a teaching tool in biology classrooms
                        everywhere. TheButterflyProject offers powerful configuration options for offering
                        relevant information and challenges to students and balanced presets if you want to
                        get started! No matter what you choose, TheButterflyProject is designed to offer a
                        fun and educational experience for your students. This tool is completely free, and
                        will remain so. Even the code for the project is open and free for anyone to view
                        and edit as they like. As for now, this is a really small project. So even if it’s
                        just for yourself to try, or you want to bring TheButterflyProject to yet another
                        classroom, we would be happy to see you in the downloads section!
