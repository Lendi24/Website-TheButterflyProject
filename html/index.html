                <h2>What is the TheButterflyProject?</h2>
                <p>The goal of TheButterflyProject is to show how a population
                    of animals evolve and change depending on their environment.
                    We aim to do this in a fun and educational way.
                    To do this we have created a game-like software,
                    with an evolution system, where “the player” is a predator with the aim of
                    catching butterflies. These butterflies are of different patterns and/or colours
                    (depending on the configuration), and therefore some will be harder to catch than others.
                    The time available to the player will decrease on each round
                    (also depending on configuration), making the game harder.
                    Since some butterflies will be easier to spot, they will also be targeted first.
                    This will make the genes of those butterflies less common,
                    and therefore those butterflies will have a lower likelihood of appearing next round.
                    This is meant to mirror how real world butterflies (and other animals) can adapt to its
                    environment by the process of evolution.

                    <h2>Why use the TheButterflyProject?</h2>
                    <p>We believe that this project could be useful as a teaching tool in biology classrooms
                        everywhere. TheButterflyProject offers powerful configuration options for offering
                        relevant information and challenges to students and balanced presets if you want to
                        get started! No matter what you choose, TheButterflyProject is designed to offer a
                        fun and educational experience for your students. This tool is completely free, and
                        will remain so. Even the code for the project is open and free for anyone to view
                        and edit as they like. As for now, this is a really small project. So even if it’s
                        just for yourself to try, or you want to bring TheButterflyProject to yet another
                        classroom, we would be happy to see you in the downloads section!

                        <p>Hello there! For TheButterflyProject I did the UI, evolution system and most of the game logic. The first thing to “get done” was the game-logic and the basic butterfly models. While Sebastian did the models, I worked on the logic and scene setup. After a while, the butterflies had a routine for spawning inside the gamearea without overlap and also being able to be destroyed by a mouse-click from the player. After that, the DNA and evolution system was next. Storing the DNA system took a little thinking, but after that was done I had no problems with it at all. The same can not be said for the evolution system, which needed constant tweaking and major parts rewritten to get balanced correctly while offering a fun experience. For the UI I used a unity preview package that is built to mimic how html/css works. brought with it a whole lot of challenges, since the plugin was really buggy. The heart icons and mouse-pointer icons are also designed in-house by me with the open-source vector-based graphics creation software “inkscape”.</p>

                        <p>General Kenobi! What I did on TheButterflyProject was the fun stuff! I worked on the models, sound effects and the animation on the main menu. For the models I used Blender, which I then imported into Unity. The sound effects were recorded using Audacity with random stuff I found in my room. The main menu animation is my most prized possession in the entire project! I made butterflies get created at the top right part of the screen and then get destroyed once they’ve moved to the bottom left part of the screen. This gets repeated so you get an illusion that there’s an endless amount of butterflies passing through the screen. After the UI was mostly done, it still felt like there was something missing. At this time, the bottom bar that shows remaining time was not there. After adding it, the game felt more complete. We also wanted some sort of effect when the butterflies were destroyed, instead of just disappearing. To fix this, we replaced the mesh of the butterfly with a broken version. These two changes were both rushed in just before a demo, and made dramatic improvements to the UX of the game.</p>
